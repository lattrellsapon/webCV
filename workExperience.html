        <p>I am currently a general contractor for the Clinical Records Department in North Shore Hospital - Waitemata District Health Board. Given my software development experience, I am currenrly building databases for them so that the staff members will not have to record their data in an Excel Spreadsheet. As for their preference, I am currently using Microsoft Access to build a database. Access allows me to creata tables, forms, queries (SQL Queries) and generate reports. </p>
