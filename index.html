        <p>I enjoy spending time with my family and friends as it allows me to relax my body and mind. Furthermore, I love playing sports and basketball is my most favourite sport. When I am not playing basketball, I like to keep myself in shape; therefore I go to the gym to stay fit. Moreover, I enjoy cooking and listening to music.</p>
